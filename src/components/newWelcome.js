              This project began several years ago when a group of friends and I
              were having lunch and bragging about all the cool bands we saw
              back in the ‘60s. I impressed everyone when I rattled off The
              Yardbirds, Mitch Ryder &amp; The Detroit Wheels, The Hollies, The
              Animals, ? &amp; The Mysterians, The Beau Brummels, Sam The Sham
              &amp; The Pharaohs, The Music Machine, The McCoys, The Kingsmen,
              The Turtles, Gary Lewis &amp; The Playboys, Lonnie Mack, Brenda
              Lee amongst others. I grew up in the middle-sized town of Cedar
              Rapids, Iowa (pop about 100.000). How was I able to witness that
              stellar array of talent in a town that size? Answer: Danceland
              Ballroom.

            <p className="mb-6">
              The ballroom was built in 1926. It was beautiful place that
              offered top live entertainment for people in Southeastern Iowa. It
              garnered a great reputation under the tutelage of a few sharp
              managers who booked an impressive lineup of big-time talent. In my
              youth Danceland was the place to go see live rock and roll and I
              attended often. It was suggested at that lunch years ago that
              someone should do a book or website and document the bands that
              played at Danceland during that time. It was also suggested if
              anyone should do this, it should be me.

            <p className="">
              Not realizing the scope of this project, I accepted the challenge
              and set about gathering all the Danceland information I could
              find. I started scouring the Danceland ads in the local newspaper,
              the Cedar Rapids Gazette. I did this by looking through microfiche
              at the public library. (I now live in Minnesota and the Cedar
              Rapids library would send the microfiche up to my local
              Minneapolis library for me to view). After I got a computer, I was
              able to find the information I was looking for via the internet.

              It started out as just a list of the more popular national bands
              from the rock and roll era. Then I realized, who am I so say who
              deserved to be mentioned or not, so I decided to list every act
              that performed there from 1955-1968. Then I started to look at all
              the famous big bands and orchestras that played there in the early
              years and decided I needed to include them too if I was going to
              properly tell the whole story.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-6">
              I was also able to find other items from scrap books, blogs, etc.
              All non-publicity photos and autographs on the website were taken
              or obtained at Danceland. I put it all together - publicity
              photos, the newspaper ads and added a comment or two about some of
              the artists and their current record release.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-6">
              I obtained information from the newspaper printed before the
              performances. I’m sure there were a few cancellations that I’m not
              aware of. If anyone has additional information, photos, etc. and
              would like to correct or add to the website please contact me. My
              mission is to make sure all information is correct and accurate.
            </p>

              With that in mind, welcome to the website that is dedicated to
              preserving the history of Danceland Ballroom in Cedar Rapids,
              Iowa. You can view the history from the grand opening in 1926 to
              its razing in 1968 (urban renewal). I’m sure you’ll agree that the
              array of top acts that graced the Danceland stage through the
              years is impressive.
